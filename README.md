The work carried out in this project is in relation to my master's degree thesis. 

The project involves the task of analysing the data coming from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and a single-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) which are the 2 different methods of monitoring the heart's electrical activity for detecting and classifying the Silent Atrial fibrillation which is a type of heart arrhythmia from the normal Rhythmic heartbeat using an LSTM network.
